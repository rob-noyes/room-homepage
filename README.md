## Lessons Learned

During this project I learned about React and how to destructure into working components.  I used react-router-dom to allow for linking to other pages on the site, and to get a better grasp on how to reuse components (i.e header for similar looks on each page).  I used useState as well to further my learning into states and how to pass them down into components, especially with functions utilizing state changes.

I also learned more aobut higher order function utilization as I needed to map through arrays and filter out specific object ids for a shopping cart.

With TailwindCSS I learned about extending the TailwindCSS config file, allowing for unique styles to be made that aren't just the base styles given.  It it also my first site using completely TailwindCSS, which has given me a better unterstanding of how quick and easy it can be to style and create responsive pages.  The utility first approach. really makes sense to me with the ability to change things so quickly straight from the HTMl (or JSX) in my case.
