# room homepage

Buidling an ecommerce homepage mainly to create a clean, easy to use UI.  Hard edges, images, and simple hover and active states.

room is built using Reactjs and TailwindCSS.  I have been spending most of my time building with these two frameworks, and found they work very well together, enough to get me to make them my main focus in development.
